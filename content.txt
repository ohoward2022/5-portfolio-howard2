Athletic: I made the freshman lacrosse team and I really like it. I have scored 4 goals this season and I plan on playing next year. I want to do summer camps to get better and work on my running. 


traveling/ explore: I like to travel and visit new places, my grandparents have a house in Portugal and we go there every other summer. I used to be able to speak a good amount of the language, but I do not take lessons with my grandfather anymore. 

I am good with technology and interested in marketing: I help my family and grandparents a lot with their phone problems and I like working with technology.

									<p> This year I have accomplished many of my goals and I am proud of that. I have done really well in school and like my classes. <br /> I have also met a lot of new people who have changed me and made me a better person.
									<br /> I made the freshman lacrosse team which was really exciting for me.  Lacrosse is my favorite sport and I am hoping to make the team next year.</p>

									<p> I am 15 years old and I have lived in Massachusetts for all of my life. I went to elementary school at Bancroft and went to Doherty Middle school. My first year at the high school was a lot better than I expected, I thought I would get lost and not make any new friends. After the first few weeks I started talking to new people and becoming close with them. This year I have learned a lot and I hope to use what I have learned in my future years here and just in general. My family is really important to me and I like spending time with them and going places with them. School is also important to me and I have been doing well this year and I am happy about my grades.  </p>

									<p> One of my favorite things to do is travel. We usually go to my grandparents house in Portugal every other summer and going there makes me really happy because I get to experience a different culture and learn new things. My family travels a lot in general for February and April breaks. This past year we went skiing for February break and went to Florida for April break. I really like traveling and exploring because I get to learn new things and have the experience of going different places. The feeling of waking up at 4am to go to the airport is exhilarating. I hope to travel a lot in the future and live my life to the fullest because you are only here once and only get a certain amount of opportunities. </p>

									<p> One thing that I really like to do in my free time or spare time is work with technology. It really interests me and I think that I'm good with it. Whenever my grandparents come up they always have issues and I always save them a trip to the apple store. I feel that I will be able to use the knowledge that I have with technology in my future carrer and continue getting better with it.  </p>

									<p> Something that I am really interested in for the future is working in Finance/ going to school for buisness. I like working with money and I am working on saving my money for my future or something big that I want. I dream of working in a city and loving what I do. Playing lacrosse is fun but I do not want to go into college playing a sport because I feel that it would be too much on top of school. If I study hard and reach my goals I think that I could be successful.  </p>
